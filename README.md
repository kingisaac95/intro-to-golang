# Intro to Go
An attempt to learn Go language basics

Here are the things I tried out to understand the language basics:
* [Hello world!](/hello/hello-world.go) - good old hello world :)
* [Variables & Constants](/variables/variables.go) - defining and passing these as values/references
* Functions - functions
* [Loops](/loops/loops.go) - for, for range
* [Arrays & Slices](/slices/slices.go) - defining slices, manipulating them, and some theory of how it works
* [Maps](/maps/maps.go) - Go's key-value pair thingy :)
* [Structs](/structs/structs.go) - defining your own types in Go
* [Concurrency](/concurrency/concurrency.go) - Basics of concurrency in Go

I took the course *Go Fundamentals - Nigel Poulton* on Pluralsight
